# tictactoe
In this project, I created a program that plays Tic-Tac-Toe with other computers on the network. In addition, gained experience with adding functionality to an existing program that was written by someone else

- In this project it uses the various Winsock Library files: connectsock.cpp, passivesock.cpp, UDP_recv.cpp, UDP_send.cpp, and wait.cpp
